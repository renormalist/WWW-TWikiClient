NAME

WWW::TWikiClient - WWW::Mechanize-based client to access a TWiki.

ABOUT

This class is derived from WWW::Mechanize for easy remote controlling
a TWiki based website. It was originally developed to migrate from a
VQWiki to TWiki.

After it lived some time under the Acme::PM::Dresden namespace I made
it an extra distribution because it seems to be useful for others.

It was originally developed during the same time when
WWW:Mechanize::TWiki appeared. I watched that other module for some
time but WWW::TWikiClient follows a more explicit implementation
approach that worked better for me.

There are many TWikis with many different skins out there. TWikiClient
tries to work quite generically. I mostly developed it with TWikis
version 01Sep2004 (Cairo release) using the PatternSkin but I also did
some tests against some other skins and twiki versions:

   * Beijing release (01Feb2003)
      * default skin (with only preview button in topic edit)
   * Cairo release (01Sep2004)
      * default skin (with several buttons in topic edit)
      * BlueSkin (the old version, probably 0.4)
      * PatternSkin
   * Dakar release 4.0.2
      * Reported to run, not tested by myself
